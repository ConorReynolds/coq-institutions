# Institutions in Coq

Ongoing project to formalise the theory of institutions in Coq.

## Building

Prerequisites are

- Coq 8.12.1
- [coq-equations](https://mattam82.github.io/Coq-Equations/) 1.2.4+8.12 (older versions have not been tested, but may work just fine)
- John Wiegley's [category theory development](https://github.com/jwiegley/category-theory). Modify [_CoqProject](_CoqProject) to point to your copy. (Building this will take a while.)

Run `make` to build.
